{"name":"SbigSharp","tagline":"C# wrapper of SBIG SDK","body":"An unofficial library, SbigSharp, is a C# wrapper for Santa Barbara Instrument Group's (SBIG) software development kit (SDK).  They've built a great SDK and C# has great facilities for wrapping C code and DLLs, and here we combine them both for your convenience and astronomical pleasure!\r\n\r\n#Contents\r\nThere are two primary pieces of useful content in this repository.\r\n\r\n##SbigSharp.cs\r\nThis file contains all the wrapping code to interface with SbigUDrv.dll.  It's broken into three parts: types, enums, and code.  The code mainly centers around calling the main function in SBIG's DLL, `SBIGUnivDrvCommand`.  There are some helper functions at the end of the file, and sprinkled in with the types.  With this file and [SbigUDrv.pdf](http://archive.sbig.com/pdffiles/SBIGUDrv.pdf), one should easily be able to understand what's happening on both the software and camera level.\r\n\r\n##Program.cs\r\nThis is largely example code in the form of a test program.  \r\n\r\nYou'll also find project and other ancillary files to get you started building using Visual Studio (2012 or newer) instantly!\r\n\r\n#Status\r\nThe full SBIG SDK has not been exhaustively exposed, but most things that most people would want to do should be there.  If not, it should be easy enough to follow the pattern and create whatever is needed.  Testing thus far has been against the SBIG camera simulator, but real hardware testing will commence shortly and any issues found will be corrected.  Any SBIG cameras made available to the project owner will happily be tested for compatibility.\r\n\r\n#Thanks\r\nThis software was made possible by the [SETI Institute](http://www.seti.org).  Their mission is to explore, understand, and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe, and to apply the knowledge gained to inspire and guide present and future generations.
