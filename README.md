### C# wrapper of SBIG SDK

SbigSharp is an unofficial C# wrapper library for Santa Barbara Instrument Group's (SBIG) software development kit (SDK). They've built a great SDK and C# has great facilities for wrapping C code and DLLs, and here we combine them both for your convenience and astronomical pleasure!
